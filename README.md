The aim of the Calvalus project is to develop a demonstration system capable of reprocessing large amount of EO data.
It uses Apache Hadoop for a massive parallelisation of processing tasks.

Calvalus has been developed from 2010 to 2011 by Brockmann Consult GmbH under contract to the European Space Agency (ESA).

This project uses Maven 3. To compile the project sources, perform all tests and build the binaries, type

> mvn package

The module calvalus-portal compiles to a Java web application archive (WAR file) that will run on J2EE compliant
application servers. The Calvalus portal at http://www.brockmann-consult.de/calvalus/ is currently run on a Tomcat 7.
